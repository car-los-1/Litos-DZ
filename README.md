My idea for the project is to create a flappy bird game. Game will be controlled mostly via the spacebar and the mouse will interact with the menu. Flappy bird jumps up and down while the screen & background moves simultaneously. I will be making standard checkpoints throughout the game in order to ensure the user's satisfaction. The game will get difficult with more objects as the user progresses throughout it.
